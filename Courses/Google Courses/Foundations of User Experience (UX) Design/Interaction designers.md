# Interaction designers

### *definition*
#### Focus on designing the experience of a [[product]] and how it functions.

They figure out how to connect the user's needs and the business's goals with what's actually feasible to build.

They strive to understand the user flow, or the path, that a typical user takes to complete a task on an app, website, or other platform. In many large companies, interaction designers are a specialized type of UX designer.

They ask questions like :

- What should happen if a user taps on this button?
- How do we make this action easier for users to complete?
- How are the design elements within the website laid out?

They focus less on how the [[product]] looks and instead strive to make the [[product]] easy to navigate and simple for users to interact with.
