They also think about how to create smooth *transitions* between pages on an app or a website.

They may also create animations or visual effects to bring their design ideas to life. At many big companies, motion designers are specialized type of UX designer.

Their work answers questions like:

- How should an app transition between pages?
- How do we show the connection between these actions?
- What's an engaging animation that will help tell our story?

They focus on design elements that move, rather than traditional static designs.
