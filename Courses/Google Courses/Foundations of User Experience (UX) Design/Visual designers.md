They are responsible for designing logos, illustrations or icons. They may also decide font colors size and placement, or work on [[product]] layouts.

They focus on the layout of each page or screen and make all of the design elements fit together in a visually appealing way. At many big companies, visual designers are a specialized type of UX designer.

The role of a visual designer entails questions like:

- What kind of visual style should icons have, in order to fit the [[product]]'s branding?
- Which color and font should we use for this button?

The goal of a visual designer is to delight users with designs that inspire, engage, and excite them.
