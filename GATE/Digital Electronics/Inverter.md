# NOT GATE (INVERTER, NEGATION)

The NOT Gate can be represented as follows :
- ![[Not Gate (Image)]]
<br>
- ![[Not Gate (Image) 1]]
<br>
- ![[Not Gate (Image) 2]] 
##### There is always some Propagation Delay in every circuit.
Propagation delay is the time taken by the input to be propagated / converted to output.
The propagation delay is represented by $\tau_{pd}$ *(tau pd)*.
The time required for the input $A$ above to convert into output $\bar A$.
